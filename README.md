# Unity Tools (UPM)

Local install:
- Unity → Window → Package Manager → + → Add package from disk… → select package.json

This package contains Editor tools (menu items under Tools/).

Honestly I do not think the .meta files are useful in this repo right now, cause for now there are just individual scripts. I just keep them because it's a common way to treat them when using git.
